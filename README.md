# API Endpoint Testing Script

## Overview

This Bash script provides a comprehensive tool for testing API endpoints with support for various HTTP methods, token management, and response parsing.

## Prerequisites

- Bash (Unix-like environment)
- `curl` installed
- `jq` (optional, but recommended for JSON beautification)

### Optional Installation of Prerequisites

#### On Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl jq
```

#### On macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash
brew install curl jq
```

## Features

- Test API endpoints with various HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- Support for bearer token authentication
- Token storage and management
- Beautified JSON response output
- Detailed success/failure reporting

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x test_endpoints.sh
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
./test_endpoints.sh
```

### Menu Options

1. **Test an endpoint**
   - Enter the URL of the endpoint
   - Specify the expected HTTP status code
   - Choose the HTTP method (defaults to GET)
   - Optionally add a request body
   - Choose to use a stored token or enter a custom token

2. **Store a new access token**
   - Save a bearer token for repeated use across tests

3. **View stored access token**
   - Display the currently stored access token

4. **Exit**
   - Close the application

### Example Workflows

#### Testing a GET Endpoint
1. Choose option 1
2. Enter URL: `https://api.example.com/users`
3. Expected status code: `200`
4. Method: `GET`
5. Use stored token? `y/n`

#### Testing a POST Endpoint with Custom Body
1. Choose option 1
2. Enter URL: `https://api.example.com/users`
3. Expected status code: `201`
4. Method: `POST`
5. Body: `{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com"}`
6. Use stored token? `y/n`

#### Managing Tokens
1. Use option 2 to store a new token
2. Use option 3 to view the current stored token
